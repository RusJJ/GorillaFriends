# What is this mod?
GorillaFriends is a mod that shows your FRIENDS! And verified players.

## Manual Installation
Be sure that you are already installed BepInEx (using MonkeModManager for example). You need x64 version. [Take it there.](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)

Unpack downloaded ZIP Archive to your GorillaTag game folder and you're ready to play!

If you're scared then copy GorillaFriends.dll to your Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/plugins folder somewhere (Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/GorillaFriends/GorillaFriends.dll for example).
